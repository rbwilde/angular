<h2>Angular 6 CRUD Application with MongoDB, Express, Node.js, And Material Design UI</h2>
</br>
<p>I tried to show you a well rounded app using Angular and some backend knowledge. I thought a simple CRUD application would be best. I ran out of time to incorporate Bootstrap and make the app responsive (and pretty). I had some difficulty with the incorporation of the backend and the current seeded information results in errors that I couldn't resolve in the time alotted but adding, editing and deleteing user created issues works.</p>
</br>

<h3>To Run:</h3>

<code>git clone git@github.com:rbwilde/angular.git</code>
</br>

<ul>
	<li>Open Terminal</li>
	<li>Navigate to the project</li>
	<li>cd into <code>backend</code></li>
	<li><code>npm install<code></li
	<li><code>npm run dev</code></li>
	<li>Open a new terminal tab</li>
	<li>cd into <code>issue-tracker</code></li>
	<li><code>npm install<code></li>
	<li><code>ng serve -o</code></li>
</ul>
